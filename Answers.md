1) What excites or interests you about coding? What did you learn this week?
-> The satisfaction of being able to bring my thought into reality is what excites me about coding. This week I learned more about figma.

2) What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?
-> A recent technological challenge I experienced was in this project itself where I tried to validate the form using a library called validator which returned the validation errors all at once in form of a 2-d array. This was new to me. I solved the problem by splitting it to smaller arrays.

3) Talk about your preferred development environment (tools and technologies you prefer using) or a cool project that you've recently worked on (if any).
-> Till date I've only majorly worked on projects With HTML,CSS and php so those are the technologies I'm familiar with. However, I want to learn new tools/techbologies.

4) What is your general expectation from this internship program? 
-> I expect this internship to become a medium that will help improve my coding skills and give me a push towards a career as a web-developer. 

5) What mediums do you prefer to learn programming?
-> I prefer watching youtube videos like that of CodeWithHarry.
